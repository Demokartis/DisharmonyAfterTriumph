 britain.1.t:0 "Our Darkest Hour"
 britain.1.d:0 "There was a time where the British Empire was the world most powerful empire. Now it just a divided and weak nation that cannot guarantee a better future for it's people.\n\nThe London Stock Market Crash of 1924 destroyed our economy, and the government proved to be useless in improving the situation. Many socialist viewed this as an opportunity to strike against our great country, conspirating to destroy the United Kingdom from the inside with the help of the French Commune. They launched a general strike in 1927 and denied every attempt of negotiation. Therefore the goverment sent the police to crack down on them. In response the Red Devils showed their real intentions, provoking chaos in all of Great Britain,killing countless of innocent civilians and destroying the values our country was built in. Martial Law was established but it was not enough to stop them. The King,to secure it's safety escaped to Australia with is family, until the situation would be improved.To save the United Kingdom, General Vereker launched a coup, which caused the Labour Party to betray the state, the departure of some colonies from our empire, and incited the Scots and Irish to revolt.\n\nEnough british men died to satiate their urge for blood. The Socialists cannot be negotiated with, the only solution for the socialist problem is and will be §Rdeath."

 makhnovia.1.t:0 "A Dream to be Realized"
 makhnovia.1.d:0 "When we took arms against the Russian state – Tsar or “democracy”, we had a dream. A dream of a classless, stateless, egalitarian, and fair society. This dream was nearly stripped from us at our inception, but we lived on. The torch of Anarchy burned brighter than the dreaded whites thought, and our light brought them to their knees. All bore the torch, all fed it with their hearts and mind, all contributed to see our dream be realized.\n\nWe organized ourselves in communes, united by the people’s decree. Our society is ruled by communal mandates and decisions taken during congresses of communes. “To each according to their need, from all according to their abilities” is how we operate. No one is left behind, no one is shunned or vilified for their way of life. No longer will the people be crushed under absurd laws and ridiculous stereotypes! We will provide the most amount of happiness, to the greatest amount of people, free of oppression, state, and injustices.\n\nWe have endured in the Ukrainian steppes, in the shadow of the Bolshevik State. They claimed our victory as their own, stripped us of our right, stripped their people of theirs. They took every liberty in the name of the greater good, forsaking the core tenants of their ideology: True democracy, not in the name of some ‘politburo’, but in the name of the people. They are no different than the tyrannical regimes of old, we are the future."

 makhnovia.2.d:0 "Life in the Free Territory is messy, and surely appears disorganized. However, life in the Free Territory is not what it might seem, from an international observer’s point of view. Every commune, a free-running gear, a well-oiled coil, or a mechanical joint - key to a beautiful mechanic of society. The people are happy, content, free.The communes organize under the black army, itself under the guise of the black Napoléon himself, Nestor Makhno. However beautiful and rewarding was life under anarchy, Nestor was tired. Preparing for war, not only territorial, but ideological, had infamously been on the order of the day of the last congresses and security council meetings for some weeks now. Organizing such an ordeal - having the burden of being chosen to lead was tiring for sure. Having to coordinate the countless militias, the disgruntled veterans and the idiots who thought enlisting would bring them glory into a coherent force is a process that takes more than being a mere mortal to complete. No matter – Nestor was resolute. They would triumph, for their cause is right. For their cause brings happiness and fulfillment, freedom and joy. Surely, every living soul would recognize that and join their cause?"
